## MVP Project Description

This game is a browser based version of one of the most basic and popular board games of all-time, Checkers. It involves two players which have pieces that move diagonally across the board and capture opponent pieces by jumping over them. The player who captures four opponent pieces will end victorious.

## Buttons

Reset: This button will return all players' pieces to their original placement on the board. As a result, the player with Black pieces will begin the game.

## Game Section

The gameboard has three visible sections throughout the gameplay - the Black pieces, the Red pieces, and the Black squares which allow the pieces to travel across the board.

To move a piece, the player must click on a piece and click on an available adjacent diagonal square to move onto. If there is a piece that is able to be captured, the player must click the space across the available opponent piece to capture it. The game is completed when players are unable to move pieces on the board as the game only allows for forward movement.

There is a table that counts the opponent pieces each player captures throughout the match as points.

Once the game is completed, a "Black wins!" or "Red wins!" heading will appear signifying which player captured four opponent pieces while reaching for the opposite end of the board.
